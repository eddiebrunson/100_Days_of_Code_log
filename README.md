## Learning Develop & Deploy Servless App material

### Day 14: June 24, 2020 - Wednesday 

**Today's Project(s):**

- Start Serverless Framework
- React Review

**Progress:**

- Finished Lesson 3 Serverless Framework
- Read [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

**Link to work:**

- [My FCC Code Portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/eddiebrunson "eddiebrunson's code portfolio on FreeCodeCamp")
- [My Cloud Developer Notes](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Cloud_Dev_Notes)
- [Refactor Udagram Project](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Refactor-Udagram-APP)

**Thoughts:**  Today I learned so much about Serverless Frameworks and when best to implement them. I understand that it's a standardized way of deploying applications, creating resources, and managing applications. React and Redux review is going well. Its nice to come back after some time and review the fundamentals to advanced concepts again. 


## Learning Develop & Deploy Servless App material

### Day 13: June 23, 2020 - Tuesday

**Today's Project(s):**

- Start Rest API Lessons
- React Review

**Progress:**

- Finished Lesson 2 Serverless Introduction 
- Read [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

**Link to work:**

- [My FCC Code Portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/eddiebrunson "eddiebrunson's code portfolio on FreeCodeCamp")
- [My Cloud Developer Notes](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Cloud_Dev_Notes)
- [Refactor Udagram Project](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Refactor-Udagram-APP)

**Thoughts:** It still feels so good to have finished the last project! I may reuse the project for my capstone by adding more features to it. Or I may covert it into a serverless application. As of today I have finish Lesson 2 on REST API. I enjoyed learning how to develop a REST API for a group of images, and how to store data in DynamoDB and build a web app using React. It ties into my review of React as I'm aslo working through [Udacity's React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) at the same time. Next up will be Lesson 3 Serverless Framework.

## Learning Develop & Deploy Servless App material

### Day 12: June 22, 2020 - Monday

**Today's Project(s):**

- Start Serverless lessons
- Prepare for React Review

**Progress:**

- Project Passed!!
- Deployed Refactor Udagram App 
- Used Travis CI, Docker, AWS, and Kubernetes
- Troubleshooting configuration/dependency errors 
- Configured Kubernetes on AWS using deployment.yml and service.yml files
- Learned how to set up Kubernetes Clusters (EKS) and thier commands
- Worked on Refactoring Udagram into microservices
- Finished Lesson 1 Serverless Introduction 
- Read [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

**Link to work:**

- [My FCC Code Portfolio](https://www.freecodecamp.com/eddiebrunson "eddiebrunson's code portfolio on FreeCodeCamp")
- [My Cloud Developer Notes](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Cloud_Dev_Notes)
- [Refactor Udagram Project](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Refactor-Udagram-APP)

**Thoughts:** Early this morning I finished troubleshooting deployment issues. It turned out that using the latest version of Kubernetes also introducted breaking issues when I tried to apply yaml files. I was able to solve the issues and get my pods running! I also turned in my project for review! I passed!! This project really was such a learning experience! Now, more than ever before I realize how vital dependencies are to the health of applications. It's very important to understand how to balance npm installs and upgrades. Now, I'm moving on to learning about Serverless Applications and working towards building a TODO application using AWS Lambda and Serverless framework. I also plan to continue learning React at the same time.

- [Refactor Udagram Project](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Refactor-Udagram-APP)

**Thoughts:** Today was such a nice warm day. I struggled to stay inside! I started the day off researching more into some of the npm warning messages I got yesterday. Due to the fact that I strongly believed the majority of my problems were dependency and storage related. I moved my development from my Macbook Pro over to my iMac. Within minutes I had my project up and running! I'm so glad to move my development environment! This is been a great learning experience. Just a few more steps to connect my app to my S3 bucket!

- [Refactor Udagram Project](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Refactor-Udagram-APP)

**Thoughts:** I have completely ran out of storage on my Macbook Pro. I moved as much as I could onto my external hard drive, but its still not enough room to complete this project. I did not realize how much storage building docker images would take up. So to remove the possibility of storage issues causing anymore docker build errors. I'm moving my development to my desktop. Last, night I ran into issues with getting my git repository to clone my most recent push. I believe that was an icloud issue. I was able to clone the repo, but the files were the same starter files I already had on my desktop. Anyways, now everything is current and on my desktop I should be fine from here on out. I realized that another cause of some of the `docker-compose up` errors were due to my local node_modules being included in the `docker build .` images. That caused dependency issues due to docker running on a different configuration than on my local machine. So to solve that I have included `.dockerignore` files for all nodue_modules. So when I create new docker images, docker will pull them on it's end and not from the image of my local environment. Next, on my list is to reconnect my app to my s3 bucket. All of these dependency issues were a headache, but I have learned so much. I know how to aviod them in the future!

- [Refactor Udagram Project](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Refactor-Udagram-APP)

**Thoughts:** I seem to have hit another issue with my project. When I `docker-compose up' it successfully builds and my app runs, but I get the following error message in the terminal: 

`node_modules/sequelize-typescript/lib/models/Sequelize.d.ts(7,40): error TS2507: Type 'typeof import("/usr/src/app/node_modules/sequelize/types/index")' is not a constructor function type.
backend-user_1  | src/server.ts(14,19): error TS2339: Property 'sync' does not exist on type 'Sequelize'.`

It may be a dependency issue. I'll try to rebuild that particular image and try again tomorrow.

- [Refactor Udagram Project](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Refactor-Udagram-APP)

**Thoughts:** I'm so happy I was finally able to get past my many npm dependency errors. I would follow the warning messages and update a dependency and it would create 5 more dependecy issues and break my project. I never had so many dependency issues before, but I learned a lot! I also figured out why I got these strange daemon errors when, I tried to build my docker image. I knew I did eveything right and I was correct! It turned out I ran out of storage on my Macbook Pro. So `docker build .` would constantly exit with various error messages such as a file system was read only. So glad I did not give up! Just a few more configurations and I'll finally be done with this project!

Although my app now runs, with a `Error response from daemon: Error processing tar file(exit status 1): chtimes /node_modules/rxjs/operators/windowToggle.js.map: read-only file system`  Seems like another dependency issue. I'm sure I'll get to running without that error.

- [My Cloud Developer Notes](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Cloud_Dev_Notes)

**Thoughts:** Yesterday was a tough day! I actually got stuck when trying to create a EKS Kubernetes Cluster. I spent hours upon hours researching the problem. Only to find out that when I created the EKS Cluster, I was logged into the AWS Console as root user. I was supposed to be logged in as a user. So I had to reconfigure things and recreated my K8 cluster and I finally got past the `Unauthorized error` I was getting. It's the best feeling in the world to solve your own problems! I feel like I enjoy learning better when I solve roadblocks! I'm very close to starting my Refactoring project. I plan to be finished with it by tomorrow!
