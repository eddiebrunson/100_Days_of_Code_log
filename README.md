**Thoughts:** I ran into a unexpected problem where I cannot deploy my Todo app using the given command 'sls deploy -v' I have to use the serverless web interface to deploy. Very strange I'm not getting any error messages, so I must be missing something in my serverless.yml file. Luckly, I'm able to deploy in a round about way. So I'm moving on for now. I also learned about Spring Boot for Web Development.

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately, I'm still dealing with a security issue so I'm continuing to work offline. It appears someone out of the country is attempting to access my devices remotely. I've already done several antivirus scans, restarted my devices, disconnected from the interent, changed all neccessary logins, and contacted tech support. After about a week of disconnecting my devices, the very same day I reconnected the attacks continued. I'm certain I'll get to the bottom of it. Anyways I've been working on my React app and my serverless TODO app.

**Today's Project(s):**

- [AWS Machine Learning Notes](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/AWS-Machine-Learning)


**Thoughts:** I'm stll working on my TODO app project. I have been dealing with a security/virus on my desktop for the past few days. So I have disconnected that device from the internet. So I've been doing my work locally until I finish quarantining my desktop. I believe the antivirus finally found the virus today. I'm surprised I got virus on my Mac as I only use it for work and I keep it locked down. The reason I believed I had a virus was my desktop kept restarting mulitple times through out the day. Also, my internet service provider kept sending me alerts that a known malicous IP from Russia was attempting to access my desktop. This has been a minor set back, bc I wasn't able to test my application locally while offline. I hope everything will be resolved soon.

- [Would You Rather APP](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Udacity_Would_You_Rather)
- [AWS Machine Learning Notes](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/AWS-Machine-Learning)


**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed learning about Software Engineering Practices, the more I learn about software engineering the more I realize how connected each field is. As the Software Engineering Practices that I know as a Developer are very similar to that of a Data Scientist. It makes sense for Data Scientist to know how to write clear, consise, modular, and test driven code just as a Software Engineer would. It makes for working together on projects more streamlined and efficient! My goal is to write more comments and docstrings in all of my projects from here on out. I have a few comments here and there throughout my old projects, but looking back I see where I can add more. My next goal is to start writing tests before I begin coding so that I follow the principle of Test Driven Development. I know these skills will help prepare me any team I join in the feature. I also worked on the Would You Rather project. Mainly, focused on improving the responsiveness and still implementing a hamburger style menu for mobile support.

Once I complete the course I will have the opperunity to take a quiz where the top 325 students will get access to the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree by AWS. I'm currenly scheduling out my time so that I can finish all three certifications at the same time! I know I can do it! I learned a lot about software engineering practices such as how to write clean and modular code, improve code efficiency, and to add effective documentation.

### Day 16: June 26, 2020 - Friday

**Today's Project(s):**

- Start Authentication 
- React Review
- Update Would Rather React APP

**Progress:**

- Finished Lesson 5 Authentication 
- Read [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- Read about [DynanoDB JSON](http://bit.ly/dynamo-db-json)

- [Would you Rather APP](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Udacity_Would_You_Rather)


**Thoughts:**  Today I finished learning about Authentication and authorization using Serverless. I learned about this before so it was good to refresh my knowledge on such an important topic. Authenication is to know how the user is, and Authorization is to know what the user can do. It has been awhile since I implemented authentication with third party providers such as Google Login or Facebook). Now that I have skill refreshed I'll be adding them to all of my personal project. On my own I want to also learn how to implement authentication with apple sign in. I also continued learning about React and Redux! It feels good to switch between different concepts. I'm still working on updating the app, so more dependency tasks even though my app runs and works. My goal is to implement redirects if a user accesses a page from the url without being logged in. Then redirects the user to login and from there redirects to the user to the intended page. I have an idea on how to implement it by using PrivateRoutes and browser history.

**Thoughts:** It still feels so good to have finished the last project! I may reuse the project for my capstone by adding more features to it. Or I may covert it into a serverless application. As of today I have finish Lesson 2 on REST API. I enjoyed learning how to develop a REST API for a group of images, and how to store data in DynamoDB and build a web app using React. It ties into my review of React as I'm aslo working through [Udacity's React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) at the same time. Next up will be Lesson 3 Serverless Framework.

- [Refactor Udagram Project](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Refactor-Udagram-APP)

**Thoughts:** Early this morning I finished troubleshooting deployment issues. It turned out that using the latest version of Kubernetes also introducted breaking issues when I tried to apply yaml files. I was able to solve the issues and get my pods running! I also turned in my project for review! I passed!! This project really was such a learning experience! Now, more than ever before I realize how vital dependencies are to the health of applications. It's very important to understand how to balance npm installs and upgrades. Now, I'm moving on to learning about Serverless Applications and working towards building a TODO application using AWS Lambda and Serverless framework. I also plan to continue learning React at the same time.

**Thoughts:** Today was such a nice warm day. I struggled to stay inside! I started the day off researching more into some of the npm warning messages I got yesterday. Due to the fact that I strongly believed the majority of my problems were dependency and storage related. I moved my development from my Macbook Pro over to my iMac. Within minutes I had my project up and running! I'm so glad to move my development environment! This is been a great learning experience. Just a few more steps to connect my app to my S3 bucket!

- [Refactor Udagram Project](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Refactor-Udagram-APP)

**Thoughts:** I have completely ran out of storage on my Macbook Pro. I moved as much as I could onto my external hard drive, but its still not enough room to complete this project. I did not realize how much storage building docker images would take up. So to remove the possibility of storage issues causing anymore docker build errors. I'm moving my development to my desktop. Last, night I ran into issues with getting my git repository to clone my most recent push. I believe that was an icloud issue. I was able to clone the repo, but the files were the same starter files I already had on my desktop. Anyways, now everything is current and on my desktop I should be fine from here on out. I realized that another cause of some of the `docker-compose up` errors were due to my local node_modules being included in the `docker build .` images. That caused dependency issues due to docker running on a different configuration than on my local machine. So to solve that I have included `.dockerignore` files for all nodue_modules. So when I create new docker images, docker will pull them on it's end and not from the image of my local environment. Next, on my list is to reconnect my app to my s3 bucket. All of these dependency issues were a headache, but I have learned so much. I know how to aviod them in the future!

- [Refactor Udagram Project](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Refactor-Udagram-APP)

**Thoughts:** I seem to have hit another issue with my project. When I `docker-compose up' it successfully builds and my app runs, but I get the following error message in the terminal: 

`node_modules/sequelize-typescript/lib/models/Sequelize.d.ts(7,40): error TS2507: Type 'typeof import("/usr/src/app/node_modules/sequelize/types/index")' is not a constructor function type.
backend-user_1  | src/server.ts(14,19): error TS2339: Property 'sync' does not exist on type 'Sequelize'.`

It may be a dependency issue. I'll try to rebuild that particular image and try again tomorrow.

- [Refactor Udagram Project](https://github.com/eddiebrunson/Refactor-Udagram-APP)

**Thoughts:** I'm so happy I was finally able to get past my many npm dependency errors. I would follow the warning messages and update a dependency and it would create 5 more dependecy issues and break my project. I never had so many dependency issues before, but I learned a lot! I also figured out why I got these strange daemon errors when, I tried to build my docker image. I knew I did eveything right and I was correct! It turned out I ran out of storage on my Macbook Pro. So `docker build .` would constantly exit with various error messages such as a file system was read only. So glad I did not give up! Just a few more configurations and I'll finally be done with this project!

**Thoughts:** Yesterday was a tough day! I actually got stuck when trying to create a EKS Kubernetes Cluster. I spent hours upon hours researching the problem. Only to find out that when I created the EKS Cluster, I was logged into the AWS Console as root user. I was supposed to be logged in as a user. So I had to reconfigure things and recreated my K8 cluster and I finally got past the `Unauthorized error` I was getting. It's the best feeling in the world to solve your own problems! I feel like I enjoy learning better when I solve roadblocks! I'm very close to starting my Refactoring project. I plan to be finished with it by tomorrow!
